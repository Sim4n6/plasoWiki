## Setting up and maintaining your development environment
The first challenge you will encounter is setting up and maintaining your development environment.

**Note that plaso and some dependencies are currently actively under development keeping up with the development release is not for "the faint of heart".**

* [Running the development release on Ubuntu Linux](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Development-release-Ubuntu)
  * [Building and installing dependencies on Ubuntu Linux](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Dependencies---Ubuntu)
* Running the development release on Fedora Linux
* Running the development release on Mac OS X

### Roadmap
A read-only version of the roadmap document can be found here: [Plaso - Roadmap and Assignment](http://goo.gl/cRjA7y). The roadmap document displays the current status, who's working on the parser, etc.

**Note that this is a general wish list, that may not be completely up-to-date.**

If you are in the developers group and want to add a parser you can just go ahead and edit: [Plaso - Roadmap and Assignment](http://goo.gl/IIs4HM) and assign it to yourself, please add a date so we can reassign if you don't have time. If you cannot program and still have a great idea for a feature please go ahead and edit, note that the priority will be who ever wants to work on it.

**TODO: add more text**

### Submitting code
There can be a code freeze announced before a release, in which we try to focus on testing and bug fixes. In such a freeze, new features will added to the codebase after the release.

**TODO: add more text**
