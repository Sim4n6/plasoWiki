Checkout the plaso source from the git repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso.git
```

To be able to run the plaso [development release](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Releases-and-roadmap) on Ubuntu or equivalent you'll have to have installed the [dependencies](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Dependencies---Ubuntu).

Check if you have all the dependencies installed and have the right minimum version:
```
python utils/check_dependencies.py
```

**Note that some dependencies are actively under development and can be frequently updated, therefore we recommend checking the status of the dependencies regularly.**

**TODO: add note and link to devtools about maintaining dependencies.**
