**TODO some notes for now**

Create a master release issue: https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/issues/new. This issue is used to track the overall process of the release and should not contain much detail. For detail link to separate issues:

Use the github markdown notation:
```
* [ ] open action item
* [x] ~~completed action item~~
```

This will add a nice status bar indicating the progress of the release.

Create a release issue label: https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/labels

Mark issues that need to be addressed before the release with the label and reference them in the master issue.
