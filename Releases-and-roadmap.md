Plaso comes in 2 different forms of releases:

* a packaged release; found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/releases)
* a development release; found in the [git repository](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso)

**Note that the development release is for development, expect frequent updates and potential breakage.**

We try to provide two packaged releases per year, a "summer" and "winter" release, but occasionally we will also do preview and release candidate packaged releases.
