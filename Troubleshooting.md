This page contains instructions that can be used to assist you in debugging potential issues with the plaso and its dependencies.

## Quick list

1. Check the [commit history](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/commits/master) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/issues?q=is%3Aissue) if the bug has already been fixed;
2. If you are running the development release make sure plaso and dependencies are up to date, see: [Developers Guide](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/wiki/Developers-Guide)

If everything fails create a new issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/issues). Please provide as much detailed information as possible.

**Note that the github issue tracker uses [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)**
