To install the Windows Packaged Release plaso you need to download the latest version from http://download.log2timeline.net

Find the highest version number (as of this time version 1.3) and inside the folder called ```release``` is a ZIP file.

The name of the ZIP file contains vs2008 or vs2010 this indicates the Visual Studio version used to build the binaries. Make sure you have the corresponding Visual C++ Redistributable package installed, which you can obtain from microsoft.com.

Extract the ZIP file and you're ready to log2timeline.
